# Simple Chatbot Workflow for n8n

This folder contains the basic prompt-only chatbot workflow from the course for use with [n8n](https://n8n.io/). It demonstrates how to quickly create a functional chatbot using minimal configuration.

## Getting Started

1. **Download** the `Simple_Chatbot.json` file.
2. **Import** it into your [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance using the workflow import tool.
3. **Configure Credentials**: The workflow may require you to set up credentials (e.g., for an API like OpenAI).

> **Heads up**: You must configure your own credentials within the relevant nodes after importing.

## Requirements

* A running [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance
* API credentials (e.g., Gemini API Key)
